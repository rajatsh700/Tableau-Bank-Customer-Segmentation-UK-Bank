This Tableau project is centered around customer segmentation based on a detailed dataset that includes Customer ID, Name, Surname,
Gender, Age, Region, Job Classification, Date Joined, and Account Balance. The primary objective of this analysis is to categorize
customers into distinct segments by analyzing demographic and financial attributes, which provides a comprehensive understanding
of different customer profiles.

The Tableau dashboard offers a visual exploration of these customer segments, revealing key patterns and trends in areas such as 
age distribution, geographic distribution, job classification, and account balances. By dissecting these data points, the project
uncovers valuable insights that can drive strategic decisions in marketing, customer engagement, and service personalization.

This customer segmentation analysis is an essential tool for businesses aiming to enhance their understanding of the customer base,
enabling more targeted marketing efforts, better customer retention strategies, and optimized resource allocation. The interactive 
visualizations in the dashboard make it easy for stakeholders to explore the data, identify key segments, and make informed decisions
based on the findings. Ultimately, this project empowers businesses to leverage data-driven insights to foster growth and improve
customer satisfaction.
